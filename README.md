# Open Source and Engineering Stickers
## About
This is a repo for designing stickers based around open source software, engineering, and StyroPyro discord server memes. There are a lot of really cool projects out there that unfortunately don't sell stickers, so we figured it would be nice to make some of our own you can download and print off yourself to display on your laptop or other purposes.

## Contributing
You can send a direct message to `@.aurorae` on discord or `@ghostoverflow` to be added to the project and help expand it. This is a community effort for better representation of some of our favorite projects and any help is greatly appreciated.

Before attempting to add any artwork to this repository, please make sure that in doing so you are complying with the law and any other restrictions by companies on what you can do with their branding. The goal is to have a fun, ethically executed project that respects all projects referenced within - NOT to rip off existing companies that sell official stickers/merchandise.
