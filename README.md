# Open Source and Engineering Stickers
## About
This is a repo for designing stickers based around open source software, engineering, and StyroPyro discord server memes. There are a lot of really cool projects out there that unfortunately don't sell stickers, so we figured it would be nice to make some of our own you can download and print off yourself to display on your laptop or other purposes.

**Disclaimer**: We are not affiliated with or endorsed by any of the projects, organizations, or groups mentioned or otherwise featured in this project. As such, these stickers are for non-commercial and personal use only.

## Contributing
You can send a direct message to `@ro.fem` on discord or `@ghostoverflow`, and pull requests are open. Any and all contributions are appreciated, though we may ask for some tweaks to be made or to make sure to follow the guidelines below.

Before attempting to add any artwork to this repository, please make sure that in doing so you are complying with the law and any other restrictions by companies or otherwise projects on what you can do with their branding. The goal is to have a fun, ethically executed project that respects and promotes those referenced within - do NOT try to merge things that would fail a "vibe check."
